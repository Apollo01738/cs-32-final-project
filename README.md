FP Design (updated)
We have decided to modify our original idea for the FP, and create an arcade of games such as hangman, maze, and possibly one other game. Players will collect coins depending on their performance, which can be used to purchase new titles or unlock new games. Additionally, we can add account functionalities so that each user can save their login info, and add visuals to make it more interesting.

The main functional blocks in this code are: 1) Account Creation. This will be responsible for creating new user accounts, storing their login info in a CSV file, 2) Main menu. This will allow the users to navigate through the arcade and select whether they want to play games/buy titles/check coin balance. 3) Games. These blocks of code will contain the various games in the arcade. They will allow users to collect coins based on their performance, which can be used to purchase new titles or unlock new games. 4) Store: This block of code will allow users to purchase new titles with the coins they have collected. 

In order to get to our final deliverable, we will first focus on creating the account creation and gameplay blocks of code, making sure that all of the logic for the games is implemented properly. We can next create the store block of code, making sure that users can purchase new titles or unlock new games with the coins they have collected. Finally, we will test the code to make sure that all of the features are working properly.
