My CS32 Final Project with Milo and Lillie
The overall dream was to create a video game, however, with our limited scope and abilities, we have decided to instead create an arcade of games such as hangman, bingo, wheel of fortune, etc. You will collect coins depending on your performance, and the coins can be used to purchase new titles or unlock new games.
